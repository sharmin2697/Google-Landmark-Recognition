# DATS-6103-DataMining-FinalProject
Group6-Landmark-Regonition-using-Google-Landmark-Dataset


This project will focus to build a model that recognizes a given popular attraction or landmark using Google landmark dataset. This landmark recognition model will be handy to identify the name of a landmark in the image..

This Repository is divided into 5 section 
1. Group Final Project Report  - Report on Group Project experiments 
2. Three Individual Project report - It contains two file - 1 PDF on individual findings and experiments contribution to the project and code file associated with it. 
3.Group Presenattion - Presentation on Project
4. Group Proposal - High level overview on Project proposal
5.CODE - Group Project Work 

CODE FILES: 
1. Main_menu.py --> Which describes starting point of execution, all associated py files are imported into it automatically. 
2. image_download.py --> subroutine that decribes image download activity
3. Feature Extraction.py --> subroutine that describes feature extraction process
4. Model Function.py --> various Model functions for prediction
5. Main.py --> contains python file without pyqt5 layer
6. DT.py,RF.py,CVS.py,EM.py,KNN.py,LR.py,NB.py,SVM.py,SVMNL.py --> GUI dialog box - Modelling and Prediction layer GUI part functions - supports for Modelling Algorithmns 
7. Model.py --> GUI layer that connects to different model algorithm file(DT.py,RF.py,CVS.py,EM.py,KNN.py,LR.py,NB.py,SVM.py,SVMNL.py)

DATA FILES: 
DATA FOLDER --> Has the train.csv -- Google landmark dataset
Resized_image --> Contains Test and Train images --> This folder is mandatory to hold downloaded images
Resized_image1 --> Errored out Image Id's 

To save computational time, Many subroutines are commented , files associated with it were extracted and preloaded for faster execution. 
Machine leraning models were pre-trained on our dataset and its loaded seperately as sav files. 

Github, doesnt allow to upload the all necessary documents and files for execution of the project , as size of file is more than 25MB, An replica version of this project with full code is present in below google drive for reference.
